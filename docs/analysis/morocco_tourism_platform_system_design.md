# Morocco Tourism Platform: System Design

## Implementation Approach

Based on the analysis of the current project state, I'll design an architecture that builds upon the existing foundation (25% complete) and implements the remaining five core sections: DISCOVER MOROCCO, MOROCCAN TOURISM, GALLERY, CONTENT HUB, and TOURISM SERVICES.

### Technical Stack

We'll leverage the existing technical foundation:
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite build system
- **UI Components**: Shadcn-ui component library (48 components)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Morocco-inspired color palette
- **State Management**: React Context API + localStorage for persistent data
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **Maps**: Leaflet.js for interactive maps (lightweight, open-source)
- **Media**: react-photo-gallery for image galleries, react-player for video content

### Backend Approach

As per the client's preference, we'll implement localStorage for backend functionality:
- Data persistence through browser's localStorage API
- JSON schema for structured data storage
- Local caching strategies to optimize performance
- Import/export functionality for data backup/restoration
- Mock API architecture to facilitate future migration to real backend

### Key Implementation Challenges and Solutions

1. **Interactive Map Implementation**
   - Solution: Use Leaflet.js with GeoJSON data of Moroccan regions

2. **Media Management without Backend**
   - Solution: Use optimized local assets + progressive loading techniques

3. **User Content Persistence**
   - Solution: localStorage with size management and data compression

4. **Offline Capabilities**
   - Solution: Service worker for caching static assets and critical data

5. **Search Functionality**
   - Solution: Implement client-side search using Fuse.js for fuzzy matching

## Data Structures and Interfaces

The platform will use a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between components and data models.

### Data Models

The following data models will be implemented and stored in localStorage:

1. **Region Model**: Represents Moroccan geographical regions
2. **Attraction Model**: Tourist attractions with details
3. **TourPackage Model**: Structured tourism offerings
4. **MediaItem Model**: Photos, videos, and user-generated content
5. **Content Model**: Articles, stories, and cultural information
6. **Service Model**: Tourist guides and transportation services
7. **User Model**: User preferences and saved items
8. **Review Model**: User reviews and ratings

### Component Architecture

The platform will use a layered architecture:
1. **Core Layer**: Basic UI components, utilities, hooks
2. **Feature Layer**: Section-specific components and logic
3. **Page Layer**: Main route components assembling features
4. **Layout Layer**: Page structure, navigation, and common elements

## Local Storage Data Schema

localStorage will be organized with the following structure:

```typescript
interface LocalStorageSchema {
  // Application metadata
  appVersion: string;
  lastUpdated: string;
  
  // Core data
  regions: Region[];
  attractions: Attraction[];
  tourPackages: TourPackage[];
  
  // Media content
  mediaItems: MediaItem[];
  contentItems: ContentItem[];
  
  // Services
  guides: Guide[];
  transportServices: TransportService[];
  
  // User data
  userPreferences: UserPreferences;
  savedItems: SavedItem[];
  reviewsAndRatings: Review[];
}
```

2. **Secondary Navigation**: Context-specific sub-navigation within sections
3. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Path-based navigation for deep content
4. **Related Content Links**: Cross-section content recommendations

### User Flow Diagram

1. Home Page → Section Overview → Detailed Content → Related Items
2. Regional Map → Region Detail → Attractions → Tour Packages
3. Gallery Categories → Media Display → Related Content → Services

## Migration Path to Backend

While the current implementation uses localStorage, the architecture is designed to facilitate future migration to a backend system:

1. **Service Layer Abstraction**: All data access through service interfaces
2. **Mock API Structure**: Following RESTful conventions
3. **Data Models**: Consistent with database schema design
4. **State Management**: Adaptable to server-state libraries

When migrating to a real backend (e.g., Supabase):
1. Replace localStorage service implementations with API calls
2. Add authentication integration
3. Implement server-side operations for data manipulation

## Conclusion

This architecture leverages the existing 25% completion of the Morocco Tourism Platform while providing a comprehensive plan for implementing the remaining five core sections. By using localStorage for backend functionality, we can deliver a fully functional platform that offers an immersive experience of Moroccan culture, tourism, and services while maintaining a path for future backend integration.
